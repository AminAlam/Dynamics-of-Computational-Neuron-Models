# Neural simulations using Brian2 
Hi guys , I just created this repository to upload some Brian2 python code ! enjoy it :)
### files:
* first file(Neuroscience_HH_FN.ipynb) contains some simulations about hodgkin-huxley and Fitzhugh-Nagumo models.
* second file(Neuroscience_Synapses.ipynb) contains some simulations about neurons synapses such as excitatory and inhibitory sunapses.
